Beautiful is {b} ugly.
Explicit is {b} implicit.
Simple is {b} complex.
Complex is {b} complicated.
Flat is {b} nested.
Sparse is {b} dense.
Readability counts.
Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules.
{a} practicality beats purity.
Errors should {n} pass silently.
Unless explicitly silenced.
In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess.
There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it.
{a} that way may not be obvious at first unless you're Dutch.
Now is {b} than {n}.
{a} {n} is often {b} *right* now.
If the {i} is hard to {e}, it's a bad idea.
If the {i} is easy to {e}, it may be a good idea.
Namespaces are one honking great idea -- let's do more of those!"""
